# Anki Kanji Grid

This is a port of the Anki-2.0 Kanji Grid addon to Anki-2.1.
This was forked from
[CaptainCaspar's version](https://www.reddit.com/r/LearnJapanese/comments/856nvq).

__This is a work in progress.__
Currently, generating the grids (mostly) functions, but saving the grids to
PNGs does not.
It is unlikely to be possible to support both 2.0 and 2.1 using the current
method of rendering.

## Usage
This addon will not be submitted to AnkiWeb until it is in a stable and useful
state. Until then, it can imported directly into Anki by dropping the
`kanji_grid/` directory into the `Anki2/addons21/` directory.

After starting Anki, select `Tools` -> `Generate Kanji Grid Automatic`. Several
windows will appear, showing grids of various arrangements.
